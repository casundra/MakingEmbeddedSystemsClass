# MakingEmbeddedSystemsClass

Hello!  Welcome to Carrie's homework.  This was done for Elecia White's Embedded Programming class via Claaspert.  I'm in the second cohort, Orange Stars.  

I'm taking this class to fill in the gaps in my mostly self-taught knowledge of embedded programming.  My engineering background is predominantly in hardware and custom board design, and I'm comparatively new at writing my own code (started in 2014 with Arduino).  I'm looking foward to learning new skills for organizing and structuring software, writing in tests from the start, and a deeper understanding of memory and how variables are passed between flash and RAM.

Highly recommend this class 5/5 (orange) stars.
