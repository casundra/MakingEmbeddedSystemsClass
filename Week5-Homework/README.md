# Week 5 Homework - Adding a CLI

OK, so I thought I was going to be able to cheat on this and just use the Pico code as-is, but apparently not?  Serial data transmitting / writing is working fine, but reading is not working.  Not quite sure what to make of it.

I was sort of able to get getchar and putchar to work, but it weirdly blocked my LED blinking.

ConsoleProcess() and uart_getc did not work.

Added extra commands via the Wokwi simulator.  That was cool!

Also, I already did the bonus last week which was creating Chapter 2 diagrams for my final project.  They're in the Week 4 folder.
