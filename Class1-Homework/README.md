# The Reclaiming My Timer
This is a way to gather hard data about who's hogging all the speaking time in your meeting.  Provided there are 4 or fewer people in your meeting.  Each person has a big lighted arcade button in front of them, hooked up to a central controller.  When the person starts speaking, they hit the button.  When they stop speaking, they hit the button again.  The central controller has an LCD screen that shows the elapsed time for the person speaking, and their total speaking time, both as seconds and as a percentage of the meeting.  There's a button next to the LCD that allows you to scroll though stats from the last 5 meetings.  A USB port provides the ability to download all data from the controller.  A toggle switch sets the controller into "meeting" or "wait" modes.  A small speaker in the controller provides warnings for talking too much and fun sound effects.
