[env:raspberry-pi-pico]
platform = wizio-pico
board = raspberry-pi-pico
framework = baremetal
debug_tool = picoprobe
upload_protocol = picoprobe
;upload_port = COM9

; COM5 is Device on work computer
; COM9 is Device on home computer
; COM14 is PicoProbe on home computer
; uploading through PicoProbe is not working, serial data pass-through does
; de-coupled power jumpers from 2 Picos so each are plugged into a separate USB port
; upload thru COM9
; note that SWD GND needs to be referenced to Picoprobe Pico in breadboard setup

monitor_port = COM5 ; using Device Pico
monitor_speed = 115200
