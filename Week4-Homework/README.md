# The palLED (working title) Diagrams & State Machine

For my final project, I want to create a tool that helps people pick LED colors using various color theory principals.  I think the ability to visualize various schemes using addressable LEDs and get the corresponding color data that details the main colors plus variables needed to implement in between colors could be really useful to anyone wanting to generate specific colors with LEDs.  The working name for this is the palLED - like "palette" but it's also a helpful friend (pal) for LEDs.

## Color Schemes

### Monochromatic

### Complementary

### Split Complementary

### Split Complementary with Complement

### Dual Complementary

### Gradient
